# The Resurgence of Measles in the United States
## 2 March 2025
---

Measles was officially declared eliminated in the United States in 2000â€”a massive public health achievement. But today, the disease is making a comeback.

So why is a preventable disease resurging? The short answer: **declining vaccination rates and political decisions that threaten public health**.

Measles cases have been rising steadily over the past decade, and **2025's early numbers suggest this year could far exceed previous years**. The reason isn't a mystery. Fewer children are getting vaccinated due to misinformation, weakened vaccine policies, and growing distrust in public health recommendations - often fueled by political figures and celebrities.

  <h2>Key Facts About the Measles Resurgence</h2>

  - [Measles](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.html) was eliminated in 2000, but [outbreaks](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5727570/) are now [increasing](https://www.kff.org/quick-take/u-s-measles-outbreaks-a-new-abnormal-in-a-time-of-vaccine-hesitancy/). 
  - In 2025 so far, the numbers already look [much higher](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html) than the same period last year.
  - Most measles cases occur in [unvaccinated](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/texas-measles-outbreak-rises-146-cases) individuals. In the latest data, 95% of cases were in people with no known vaccination history.
  - Hospitalization rates are high. About 1 in 5 measles cases in 2025 has required hospitalization.
  - Vaccination rates are declining, especially in certain states. Many states have fallen below the [95%](https://time.com/7262314/measles-cases-united-states-rise-worldwide-outlook/) vaccination threshold needed for herd immunity.
  - Political rhetoric and misinformation are fueling the problem. High-profile figures like RFK Jr. are pushing anti-vaccine messaging that [directly contributes](https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-02-27_measles.htm) to lower immunization rates and increased outbreaks.
